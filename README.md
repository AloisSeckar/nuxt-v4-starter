# Nuxt Starter
This is a simple but full functional starter for [Nuxt framework](https://nuxt.com/)

## About
It basically contains the same as [Nuxt Starter on StackBlitz](hhttps://stackblitz.com/github/nuxt/starter/tree/v4) featured by Nuxt team as the online playground, but without `<NuxtWelcome>` component and with additional [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration for static JS code analysis (including settings for VS Code for auto-fix on save), which I found very useful and worth adopting from your very first steps.

I recommend this setup for learning and testing purposes or for simple projects only. As a starting point for a real application, I'd advise you consider picking my [`nuxt-ignis`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-ignis) project which provides more useful features and integrations.

If you want to learn more about Nuxt, visit my [`demos-nuxt`](https://github.com/AloisSeckar/demos-nuxt) project with tutorials and examples.

## How to use
1. `git clone https://github.com/AloisSeckar/nuxt-v4-starter.git`
2. `cd nuxt-v4-starter`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. `http://localhost:3000/`

Congratulations. You have working Nuxt app project enhanced with ESLint and you can start building atop it.
